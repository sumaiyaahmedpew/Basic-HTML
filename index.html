        Bangladesh
    </h3>
    <p>
        Bangladesh is a small and beautiful country in South Asia. We got independence in 1971 from Pakistan after a long war. Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country. 16 December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered.

        Quota MOvement
    </h3>
    <p>
        The quota movement in Bangladesh, primarily driven by students, initially aimed to reform the quota system for government jobs, advocating for a merit-based system. The movement escalated after the government's response to the protests, particularly the July 2024 massacre, which led to widespread public anger and a broader anti-government uprising, known as the July Revolution.
